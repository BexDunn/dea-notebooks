    "* Generate a list of netCDF files within a specified folder location\n",
    "* Opens each netCDF file and:\n",
    "    * Keep only pixels identified as wet at least 10% of the time\n",
    "    * Convert the raster data into polygons\n",
    "    * Filter the polygons based on size and proximity to identified major rivers\n",
    "    * Remove any named water bodies - e.g. lakes\n",
    "* Append the final polygon set to a shapefile\n",
    "\n",

    "This code requires that you have run `datacube-stats` to produce WOFS summaries as netCDF files. This code takes in the folder location to generate a list of netCDF files to process.\n",
