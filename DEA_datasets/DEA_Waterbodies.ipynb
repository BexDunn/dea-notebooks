       "### Background\n",
       "<p>It is important to have up-to-date information about the extent and location of surface water in Australia. It provides us with a common understanding of this valuable and increasingly scarce resource.</p>\n",
       "\n",
       "### What this product offers\n",
       "<p>Digital Earth Australia Waterbodies uses Geoscience Australia’s archive of over 30 years of Landsat satellite imagery to identify where almost 300,000 waterbodies are in the Australian landscape and tells us the wet surface area within those waterbodies.</p>\n",
       "\n",
       "<p>The tool uses a <a href=\"https://www.ga.gov.au/dea/products/wofs\">water classification</a> for every available Landsat satellite image and maps the locations of waterbodies across Australia. It provides a time series of wet surface area for waterbodies that are present more than 10% of the time and are larger than 3125m<sup>2</sup> (5 Landsat pixels).</p>\n",
       "\n",
       "<p>The tool indicates changes in the wet surface area of waterbodies. This can be used to identify when waterbodies are increasing or decreasing in wet surface area.</p>\n",
       "\n",
       "<p><strong>Disclaimer: This graph shows the wet surface area of waterbodies as estimated from satellites. It does not show depth, volume, purpose of the waterbody, nor the source of the water.</strong></p>\n",
       "\n",
       "### Applications\n",
       "<ul><li>Understand and manage water across Australia</li>\n",
       "\t<li>Gain insights into the severity and spatial distribution of drought</li>\n",
       "\t<li>Identify potential water sources for aerial firefighting during bushfires</li>\n",
